At the moment the android app is pretty default.
We would love a material design but as coders we're bad designers.

The app features in the end will be
- Setup app (enter the nextcloud server settings)
- Display vault list
- Login to vault
- Display credential list
- Display a single credential (nicely formatted)
- Search credentials
- Edit a credential
  - Bear in mind that passman allows users to add custom fields (text / password / file)
  - Passman allows users to save their One time password token for generation
  - Should include a password generator
