The Creative Team plays a role in a variety of projects across the Digital Strategy Section (DSS), Division of Communication (DOC), and collaborates with the Division of Information and Communication Technology (ITCD), and other Divisions, and Regional and Country offices. Our design work ranges from initial project conception and ideation, through strategy, prioritization, visual design, to final delivery and implementation. The Designer inputs at each stage.

The front-end design of the UNICEF.org platform is based on a comprehensive design system -- our Design Model. The Design Model is a robust atomic, symbol based design system that governs the styles of all front-end implementations of UNICEF's Drupal component-based CMS. The master Design Model file is formatted in Sketch, with handover and specifications in various platforms such as InVision.

Our editors, globally, all use the same Design Model components to build their sites, pages and campaigns. The Creative Team, therefore, inherently supports global editorial efforts by providing and enhancing the design of the platform and its features, and best enabling our editors create and publish their content.
