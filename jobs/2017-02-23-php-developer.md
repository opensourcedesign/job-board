**Position Description**

We are looking for a PHP Developer motivated about developing web solutions ranging from managing back-end services to handling interchange of data between the server and front-end. Your primary focus will be the development of all server-side logic, definition and maintenance of the central database, and ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end. You will work both on projects requiring you to directly handle UI and on projects in which a co-worker will handle most of the UI.

* The ability to work from wherever you want. Whether you prefer traveling and working from exotic beaches or spending time with your family and working from home, the choice is yours.
* Access to a thriving, collaborative community of talented peers.
* Invitations to frequent Toptal events going on around the world, including dinners, tech talks, conferences, and more.
* Extremely competitive compensation.

**Responsibilities:**

* Integrate user-facing elements developed by front-end developers.
* Handle server/front-end data interchange and work on front-end as needed.
* Build efficient, testable, and reusable PHP modules.
* Solve complex performance problems and architectural challenges.
* Ensure high performance and optimize speed in the back-end.
* Integrate data storage solutions, including work with databases, key-value stores, blob stores, etc.
* Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders.
* Take smart risks and champion new ideas.

**Requirements:**

* Strong knowledge of PHP web frameworks such as Laravel, Yii, etc.
* Deep understanding of MVC design patterns, object-oriented PHP programming, and the fully synchronous behavior of PHP.
* Understanding of front-end technologies, including JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
* Strong knowledge of the limitations of PHP as a platform and its workarounds, as well as solutions to common PHP or web server exploits.
* Strong knowledge of fundamental design principles behind a scalable application.
* Experience with user authentication and authorization between multiple systems, servers, and environments.
* Experience integrating multiple data sources and databases into one system.
* Experience creating database schemas that represent and support business processes.
* Proficient understanding of code versioning tools such as Git.
* Be willing to help your teammates, share your knowledge with them, and learn from them.
* Be open to receiving feedback.
