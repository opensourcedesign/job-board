We are looking to create a Design Documentation which can be used by Open Source projects. Similarly how development processes are documented on git platforms, we want to create documentation for design assets (not UI/UX though yet). It would include best practices, open standards to adhere to, what tools to use, how to convert proprietary formats into open formats and ways to open up design processes for the project. It's a relatively open task so your experiences are welcome
