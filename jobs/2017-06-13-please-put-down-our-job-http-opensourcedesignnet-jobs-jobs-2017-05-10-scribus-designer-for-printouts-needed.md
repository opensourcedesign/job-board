I was told the job offering of FSFE that you can find here: http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/jobs/2017-05-10-scribus-designer-for-printouts-needed has already been put down but is not. Please do so, the offering does not exist anymore and we do not like people to get disspatointed again and again because they apply for a job that does not exist.
