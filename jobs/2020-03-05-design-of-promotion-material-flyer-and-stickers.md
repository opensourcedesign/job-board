We are a local GNU+Linux user group based in Berlin, that wants to spread Free and Open Source Software and the knowledge about it, with a special focus on Linux.

To promote our charitable organization, we would like to have some promotion material including a flyer with general information about us and our activities, stickers, that we can hand out to people and a (optional) poster to hang up at events.

As we know, that you put as much heart into your voluntary work as we do, we want to give you a small compensation for your work.
