## About us 

Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet. Use it as a mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chat room, and more! 

## About the job

We’re ideally looking for someone in the UTC -1 to +5 timezone (Europe, Africa, Western/Central Asia), but we will consider skilled candidates in all time zones.

Designers at Discourse are generalists, you’ll ultimately do a bit of everything. This ranges from improving the UX/UI of Discourse, creating mock-ups, updating our website, and implementing design in HTML and CSS.

A large part of this position will involve working with Enterprise customers to implement custom themes for their Discourse communities.

Everyone on the Discourse team also lends a hand with customer support on our Meta forum and directly with customers via email.

## About you

You work well independently and remotely with minimal amounts of day-to-day micromanagement. You should be comfortable managing your own time and prioritizing your own work. At Discourse the ability to communicate well in writing is paramount. Most of your interaction with team members will be in writing. You will also interact regularly with the public on https://meta.discourse.org. We have no central physical office, we are 100% remote.

Your designs should be simple and easy to use; you care about typography, hierarchy, and layout. You can quickly produce UI mock-ups (the software you use to do so is up to you!). You should have strong knowledge of HTML, CSS (we use SASS), and web standards. It would be nice if you had moderate JavaScript experience, but candidates without past experience who are willing to learn as they go are also welcome.

You should have 2+ years experience interpreting brand guidelines and implementing design that conforms to them. When things are busy you’ll work on multiple ongoing customer projects and during quieter times you’ll look for ways to improve Discourse and develop new open-source themes for Discourse communities.

You should be kind to your co-workers. We believe in having a welcoming workplace where people with very diverse backgrounds and cultures meet together to create something great. People from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

## About our Pay & Benefits

Discourse pays competitive salaries factoring your geographic region. We provide many benefits including a very flexible work schedule, 5 weeks of holiday a year, funding for a co-working space, and more (https://www.discourse.org/team#benefits). 

If you’re interested in this position, introduce yourself in an email to team@discourse.org.
