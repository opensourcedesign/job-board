Energized-ID-Django is an open source web based ID badge software that aims to be faster and freer than most commercially available ID badge software by being web based and open source. I am looking for a basic logo to help get this project off of the ground as I believe that this project will not be production ready without some sort of branding. I'm open to any ideas and will credit the designer(s) in the app and on the github. Some ideas I had were to use the bootstrap primary blue color as the app uses that color a lot and to make it somehow related to identity, cardholders, badges or people (I'm not really good with fingerprints as those scream cheap to me).
