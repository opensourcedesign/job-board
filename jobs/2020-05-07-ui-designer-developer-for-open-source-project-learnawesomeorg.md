LearnAwesome intends to build humanity's universal learning map. You can think of this as GoodReads on steroids as it curates links to not just books, but courses, articles, videos, podcasts, games, newsletters, forums and much more.

The current design was built with a standard Bootstrap theme, but the project is now migrating to Tailwind CSS. We are considering a design revamp at the same time. See issue: https://github.com/learn-awesome/learn/issues/138

Our ideal candidate would be someone who can not just create mockups but also convert them to Tailwind-basesd templates in a Rails project.
