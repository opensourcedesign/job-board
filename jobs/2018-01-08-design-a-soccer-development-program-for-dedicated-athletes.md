Soccer Gym is looking to open source design technologies that will help train athletes on a regular basis. The purpose of these technologies are to help strengthen athletes muscles with proper techniques and repetitive movements. Users will have their time logged into a database where all users can track their own training times, and trainers can manage their athletes. Leadership boards will display most active users and rank them according to time used and successful games played.
