Opt Out is a set of tools designed to help female identifying people engage with healthy debate online. 

Our main tool works like adBlocker, but instead of removing adverts it removes online misogyny from an individuals social media feed. Our second tool is our website but as you can see it's very minimal at the moment.

The idea behind the website is to 

1) Inform people about Opt Out
2) Inform people about online misogyny
3) Demo our browser extension
4) Allow an individual to submit details of their harassment, so we can build a dataset

Currently it does none of this well! So we really need your help :)
